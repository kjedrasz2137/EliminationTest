# EliminationTest

This repository contains the solution to the first task of the Elimination Test - the first stage of BEST Coding Marathon 2023.

## Problem description

In the internet age, we increasingly encounter filtering of comments or chat in terms of offensive content. In the case of many websites, this is due to the need to maintain a certain level of culture, due to the requirements of advertisers who do not want their brand to be associated with "inappropriate environments". Nevertheless, the filters currently in use still do not work perfectly - their creators, in order to limit the number of "false positives", often settle for limited solutions. Furthermore, internet users who want to bypass censorship make matters more difficult by using tricks such as replacing certain letters in words with similarly looking signs, or writing in a not entirely grammatically correct way. As a result, the initially trivial problem of removing offensive content becomes significantly more difficult (for example, a chat filter introduced some time ago in one of the popular games did not allow the use of the word night because of the alleged similarity to a very unpleasant word).

## Task

The goal of the task is to implement a filter that replaces letters of Polish swear words with asterisks (*).
